# nigerian-judgements
Scraper project to extract case details from the official government website

To start the scraper run <code>scrapy crawl judgements</code> from the command line

By default this scraper extracts the first case in the "Banking & Finance" section titled "3PLR – A.C.B. LTD. V. BABAYEMI (HC) – Judgements"

You can customize the category and case number you want to scrape by editing the <code>nigeria.py</code> file to your liking

Don't forget to install dependancies as they are prompted

Results can be viewed on <code>https://helloworld-4c1b2.web.app/</code> for every case crawled (Added at the bottom of the table - Make sure to refresh the page first) 

Happy Scraping!
